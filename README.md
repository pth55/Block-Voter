# Block-Voter: A Fulll-Stack Ethereum-Based Electronic Voting DApp

Block-Voter is a full-stack decentralized application (DApp) designed to provide a secure, transparent, and efficient voting system using blockchain technology. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, it ensures the integrity of election processes, prevents fraud, and provides real-time transparency. This project leverages cutting-edge technologies like React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and Solidity to modernize the voting process.

## Features

- **Decentralized Voting**: Ensures that all votes are stored on a tamper-proof blockchain network.
- **Voter Authentication**: Integrates Aadhaar-based authentication for seamless and secure voter identification.
- **Smart Contracts**: Utilizes Solidity-based smart contracts to enforce election rules and maintain data integrity.
- **Gas Fee Optimization**: Conducts efficient transactions with cost-effective gas fees.
- **Real-Time Transparency**: Allows voters to track election outcomes instantly after the results are declared.
- **Scalability**: Designed for small-scale elections but scalable for larger use cases in the future.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js for building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic and API handling.
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum for storing election data on a decentralized ledger.
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity for implementing voting logic and election rules.
- **Ganache**: Local blockchain for development and testing.
- **Web3.js**: For interaction between the frontend and blockchain network.

## Architecture

Block-Voter follows a decentralized architecture:
1. **Frontend**: React-based interface for voter registration, voting, and result viewing.
2. **Backend**: API services to manage requests and interact with smart contracts.
3. **Smart Contracts**: Deployed on the Ethereum blockchain to handle vote casting, result declaration, and candidate management.
4. **Blockchain**: Stores immutable records of votes and ensures transparency.
